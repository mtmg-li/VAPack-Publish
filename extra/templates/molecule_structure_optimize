# Initialization

ISTART = 0 ! Start from scratch
ICHARG = 2 ! Start from scratch with superposition of charge densities

# Electronic

ISMEAR = 0 ! Gaussian smearing
SIGMA = 0.1 ! Degree of gaussian smearing in eV

# Ionic

IBRION = 2 ! Ionic relaxation using conjugate gradient
ISIF = 2 ! Positions free, cell shape and volume fixed

# Algorithms

LREAL = Auto ! Automatically determine real-space projections
ALGO = VeryFast ! RMM-DIIS algorithm for a very fast relaxation
PREC = Normal ! Standard precision
