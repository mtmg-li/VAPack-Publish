# Ionic

IBRION = 0 ! Choose molecular dynamics
MDALGO = 3 ! Using Anderson thermostat
ISIF = 3 ! Compute stress tensor but do not change box volume
TEBEG = {TEBEG} ! Initial temperature
NSW = {NSW} ! Number of time steps
POTIM = 1.0 ! Time steps in femtoseconds
LANGEVIN_GAMMA = 0.0 ! Set Langevin species friction coefficient; must be zero per species, otherwise it's NpT
LANGEVIN_GAMMA_L = 0.0 ! Set Langevin species lattice friction coefficient, must be zero, otherwise it's NpT
